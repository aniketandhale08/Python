"""
By using *args You can now pass multiple arguments to the function, and it will treat them as a tuple.
you cannot directly implement *args without a function, 
because the purpose of *args is specifically to allow a function to accept a variable number of arguments.

# def average(*args):
#     avg = sum(args) / len(args)

# average1 = average(10, 20, 30)  
# average2 = average(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)   
# print(average1)
