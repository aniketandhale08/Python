Decorators are used to add functionality to functions (e.g., logging, validation) without modifying their original code. 
They improve code reusability, clarity, and maintainability by separating additional behavior from core logic.

# Short Description:
This code uses a decorator to add behavior before and after the `greet` function runs. 
It prints extra messages without changing the original function.

# Flow:
1. Decorator (`simple_decorator`) wraps the function with additional behavior.
2. @simple_decorator replaces `greet` with a `wrapper` function.
3. When you call `greet()`, it:
   - Prints "Before the function runs".
   - Calls the original `greet()` â†’ prints "Hello, World!".
   - Prints "After the function runs".

# Why Use a Decorator?
- To add extra functionality to functions without modifying them.
- For code reusability and cleaner organization.
